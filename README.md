# ArtificialAMF
This repository accompanies the paper "On the Creation and Optical Microstructure Characterisation of Additively Manufactured Foam Structures (AMF)" and holds the source code for the synthetic image generation pipeline.
 
## Prerequesites
We recommend creating a virtual environment with your favourite tool, but you won't need a lot of special packages for this repo.
The basics with numpy, matplotlib and cv2 are sufficient. 

## Repo Organization
There are two folders in this repo:
- src/ contains all source code as well as the examples folder where you'll find examples that show you how to generate images - from scratch and from a given config file. The examples folder has it's own ReadMe explaining the contained scripts and notebook.
- configs/ contains example config files that were generated while generating the images you'll find in the paper.
